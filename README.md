# One_click_shop_model
One-Click Shop is an online store selling a variety of products, including children's items, home goods, small appliances, cosmetics, and groceries. Recent reports indicate a decline in customer engagement, and acquiring new customers is no longer as effective. The proposed solution is to boost retention by providing personalized offers to existing customers.

As a modern data-driven company, One-Click Shop aims to make decisions based on data analysis and business modeling rather than intuition. This project focuses on developing a recommendation system to tailor promotions and enhance customer loyalty.

Customer Segmentation – Identifying key user groups based on purchase history.

Personalized Recommendations – Suggesting relevant products using collaborative filtering or other ML approaches.
